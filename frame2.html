<p><font color=white>Red velvet cake is a moist, tender cake with a mild chocolate flavor and a slight tanginess from buttermilk and vinegar. The vibrant red color is one of its signature features, often achieved with food coloring, though it was originally a result of a reaction between cocoa and acidic ingredients. The cake is typically made with a combination of flour, sugar, cocoa powder, and buttermilk, giving it a soft, velvety texture. It's commonly frosted with a rich cream cheese or buttercream frosting, which complements the cake’s flavor and adds to its creamy, indulgent taste. Known for its striking appearance and unique flavor, red velvet cake is a favorite for celebrations, birthdays, and other special occasions.</p>

1 tablespoon cocoa powder<br>

1 teaspoon baking soda<br>

1 teaspoon salt<br>

1 ½ cups vegetable oil<br>

Recipe for cake<br>
Step1:Preheat the Oven:
Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans or line them with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>
<p>Step2:Mix Dry Ingredients:
In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cocoa powder. Set the bowl aside.</p>
<p>step3: Prepare Wet Ingredients:

In a large bowl, combine vegetable oil, buttermilk, eggs, red food coloring, vanilla extract, and white vinegar. Use a whisk to mix everything until it’s well combined.
</p>
<p>step4:  Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:

Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing until everything is just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</p>
<p>Step5:Pour into Pans:

Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans. Use a spatula to spread the batter evenly in the pans. 
</p>
<p>Step6: Bake the Cake:

Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. If the toothpick comes out with wet batter, bake for a few more minutes.
</p>
<P>Step 7:Cool the Cakes:

Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for about 10 minutes. Then, remove the cakes from the pans and transfer them to wire racks to cool completely.

<p>
For the Cream Cheese Frosting<br>
 step1: Beat Cream Cheese and Butter:

In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese and butter together using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy (about 2-3 minutes).</p> 
 <P>step2:Add Powdered Sugar:

Gradually add powdered sugar (one cup at a time), beating well after each addition, until the frosting is smooth and fluffy.</p>
<p>step3:Add Vanilla Extract:

Add vanilla extract and beat again to incorporate.
</p>
<p>
Assemble the Cake:<br>
step1:Frost the Whole Cake:
Use the remaining frosting to cover the top and sides of the entire cake. You can smooth the frosting with a spatula or create swirls for a more decorative look.</p></h2>
<p>step2:Chill and Serve
For the best texture and easier slicing, chill the cake in the fridge for about 30 minutes to set the frosting.</p>
